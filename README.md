# Car Auction
An application that provides users with an opportunity to sell their cars on the auction or at a fixed price. Users can browse, sort and add the vehicles in to their wishlist. The sellers can monitor how many people looked at the vehicle, how many added their car into a wishlist and create promotions for their car to be sold quicker. The application is still in development but many features were already implemented.
